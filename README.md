Credit Card Fraud Detection project uses two datasets and three machine learning models to determine which dataset and machine learning model is the best for classifying fraudulent transactions using credit cards. We used two datasets, one of which was an imbalanced dataset between the two classes, and the other was balanced between the two classes. The three machine-learning models used in this project are K Nearest Neighbours, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. We compared the models using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precession, recall, f1 score, confusion matrix, and roc-auc curve.
